Outdated but too lazy to commit the finished thing.

Works with ANSI codes, simplifies using them by having functions for certain aspects like changing cursor position while parsing text for formatting markup and making it work in newer terminals. It supports a variety of color modes so even older terminals can get some use out of it but to use the full 24bit color mode you need a newer terminal, the regular windows 10 terminal has been tested, it works for the most part. the MS store terminal has some additional functionality that can be used, more formatting mainly, however there are some issues with colors that need to be ironed out. testing on linux will eventually happen, tests on MacOS terminals probably not.
